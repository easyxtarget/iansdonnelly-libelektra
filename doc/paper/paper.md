# Summary

Applications today typically directly work with custom configuration files.
Up to now, it was difficult to integrate and specify the configuration of such applications.
Elektra [@elektra] provides a framework to bridge this gap [@raab2010thesis].

The research value of Elektra is two-fold:
First Elektra allows us to intercept unmodified applications [@raab2016unanticipated] and extend their configuration access with the features Elektra has [@raab2015kps].
Second Elektra provides a plugin framework [@raab2016improving] where researchers can experiment with new configuration features.
Elektra allows us to directly apply novel ideas on many existing applications for case studies.
Furthermore a code generator [@raab2015safe] simplifies writing new applications [@raab2014program].
