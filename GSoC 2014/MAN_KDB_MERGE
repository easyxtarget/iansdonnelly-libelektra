kdb merge [options] basepath ourpath theirpath mergepath

Completes a three-way merge between keysets and saves the resulting keyset to mergepath

mergepath .. path where the merged keyset should be saved
ourpath .. path to the keyset to serve as ours
theirpath .. path to the keyset to serve as theirs
basepath .. path to the base keyset

-H --help                print help text
-I --interactive         interactive mode to manually merge
-Q --quiet		 user will not be prompted, if conflicts exist, merge will fail
-O --ours		 conflicts will default to our keyset
-T --theirs		 conflicts will default to their keyset
-V --version             print version info

MERGE STRATEGIES

ours
	This method favors our  version of a key when a conflict exists during a merge.  When a change exists between their and base, their's key will be used when there is no conflict between our and their. 

theirs
	This works just like ours, but favors theirs. 

HOW TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS

If a conflict occurs, the user will be promted on how to handle it. There will be two options:
	1) Abort the merge. This option will allow the user to stop the merge process and will leave the child and base keysets alone.
	2) Resolve the conflicts. If the user selects this option they will be given another menu on how to proceed.
		a) List keys with conflicts. This option will display a list of the keys that cause conflicts in the merge, from here a user could manually resolve conflicts in those keys and then reattempt the merge.
		b) Work through the merge. This option would list the keys needing to be manually merge, after a confirmation, the user would be prompted to work through each merge one by one. After they are done, the merge will be completed.
