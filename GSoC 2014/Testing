PLANS FOR TESTING MY WORK

kdb merge:

I plan to test the kdb merge fucntion by writing a series of tests in tests/shell/test_merge.sh
Tests will consists of merges of various keysets that we create in order to test likely errors in the merge code.
There will be a test in which ours and theirs are the same (the merge should just be take from ours).
Additionally, there will be tests in which ours or theirs matches base (the merhe should consist of the differing keyset). 
There will be a test where a key from ours differs from base, and a key of theirs differs from base (not the same key, the merge should reflect both changes).
There will be a test for when a key is appended to theirs or ours (key should be appended to merged).
There will be a test when a key is removed from theirs or ours (key should be removed from merged).
There will be tests for conflics such as when theirs and ours have a key that differs from base (kdb merge should fail or go to interactive mode).
There will be a test for when our keyset removes a key and theirs edits the same key (same expected behavior as above).

Applying to Package Upgrades:
There will be many tests using real configuration files that were mounted or imported into KeySets.
I plan to work with other members of the Elektra team such a Felix to understand how config files can be turned into elektra KeySets.
Additionally, I need to work with package maintainers to impliment kdb merge into package upgrades and make sure there is full compatibility.
